# Tic-tac-toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is a one-week school project that aims to recreate the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns marking X or O symbols. The objective of the game is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols.

Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe and enjoy the timeless challenge of this classic game!

### Features

- Player Names: At the beginning of the game, you can enter the names of the two players. One player will be assigned the X symbol, and the other player will be assigned the O symbol.

- Gameplay: Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid by selecting an empty cell. The game enforces the turn order, allowing each player to make a move before switching turns.

- Winning Condition: The game will automatically detect when a player has won by forming a line of three matching symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It will declare the winner and end the game.

- Draw: If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has formed a winning line, the game is declared a draw.

- Highscore: During the current session, the game keeps track of the highscore, displaying it on the screen. However, please note that the highscore is reset if the game is quit or refreshed.

- Play Again: After a game ends, players have the option to play again. Choosing this option will reset the grid and allow the players to start a new game with the same names.

### Limitations

- No Online Multiplayer: This version of Tic-Tac-Toe does not support playing with friends online. It is designed to be played locally between two players on the same device.

- No AI Opponent: The game does not provide an AI opponent to play against. It requires two human players to take turns and compete against each other.
